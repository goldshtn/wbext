# wbext

This is an example WinDbg extension written in C#. It doesn't offer very interesting functionality -- it has a `!wb` command that navigates to an HTTP URL and displays the result as a string in the debugger output window.

This extension is largely based on [Rodney Viana's sample](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rodneyviana/2016/05/18/windbg-extension-written-completely-in-c/), licensed under the GPL.
